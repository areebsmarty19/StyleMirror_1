The traditional online shopping experience presents a significant challenge to consumers, as it
lacks the ability to provide an accurate representation of how fashion and lifestyle products
will look and fit in a real-world context. Shoppers face the dilemma of making purchase
decisions without the ability to virtually try on accessories, or other visual products, resulting
in uncertainty, increased returns, and a less-than-optimal shopping experience.
This gap in the online shopping landscape highlights the need for an innovative solution that
seamlessly combines augmented reality and fashion, empowering consumers with the means
to virtually try on products and make informed, satisfying purchase decisions. The problem to
be addressed by this project is the limited interactivity and immersion in online fashion and
retail shopping, necessitating the development of a AR style mirror to enhance the user
experience, reduce uncertainty, and bridge the gap between the physical and digital
shopping worlds.

Our proposed work aims to develop an advanced virtual try-on system,
specifically tailored for the fashion industry, named "Style Mirror AR."
This system will leverage cutting-edge technologies such as augmented
reality (AR) and deep learning to provide users with a highly immersive
and realistic virtual try-on experience. By seamlessly overlaying virtual
clothing items onto live video feeds captured by users' devices, Style
Mirror AR will enable customers to visualize how garments look and fit
in real-time, enhancing their confidence in making online purchases.
